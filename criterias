Here are the criterias which he should achieve to successfully pass the probation period:
- Getting around project which was written decades ago by army of programmers which had their own styles of code.
- Gaining telepathic knowledge of where data is missing and what should be added even if the data is not visible by the SQL query results,but it is in one of the 25 tables (hidden in 100+ lines of SQL query).
- Working with SQL,Java,Flow,GlassFish,Solaris on professional level even if he had no experience like that on *NIX systems at all.
- Magically know everything about things that were made before he was even born.
- Instantly understand all ideas of the program, and it`s code.
- Stop asking questions to which he does not have answers himself.
- Being grateful for the opportunity to degrade your programming skills, and getting 0.80Ls a hour. 
- Being completely calm when being thrown from one task to another while not getting any guidelines or receiving really old,obsolete and inadequate guides.
- Stop asking for the help of the team members because they are starting to get angry because they cannot explain everything to an a intern and practically he is not even needed in this project, but if he is here he must magically know where to 'dig' for explanations and guides.
- If he passed java bootcamp then he knows jUnit tests and that is a must, even if they are using unknown to him and 60% of the programmers technologies.
- Understand the wicked translations from Finnish by our beloved Google Translate or even worse.
- Be able to build the project which uses dozen of third party libraries/extensions, and configuring third party software (hello maven) by adding env. variables about which you heard this week for the first time.
- Be able to configure eclipse fully (to know where to attach custom formatting or correct jdk), and also telepathically tell what version is best used.
- Be able not to commit suicide.
